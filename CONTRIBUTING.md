# Contributing
Contributors are very welcome! **No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.**

## Bashly
This project is created using the fantastic [Bashly](https://bashly.dev) framework. Be sure to reference the Bashly docs
to understand how to make changes to the CLI.

## Building
Once you make changes, simply run `make build` and it will generate a new `dtools` script in the project root.
